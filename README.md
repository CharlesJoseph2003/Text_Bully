# Text_Bully 🎭

Because sometimes your friends' messages are just *begging* to be mocked. This sophisticated piece of sass-tech takes your friends' precious thoughts and turns them into the snarky responses they truly deserve.

## What It Does (Besides Destroying Friendships) 🎯

- Takes your friend's probably-not-that-deep message
- Crafts a delightfully condescending response
- Converts it to speech with that *perfect* tone of mockery
- Generates a video that'll make them question why they even text you
- All powered by AI, because manually being sassy is so 2023

## Why Though? 🤔

Because:
- Your friends need to be taken down a peg
- Manual eye-rolling is exhausting
- Sarcasm is an art form that deserves automation
- We had the technology, and we chose to use it for this

## How to Unleash the Sass 🚀

1. Clone this masterpiece:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-bully.git
cd text-bully/frontend
npm install # Install the tools of destruction
```

2. Set up your credentials (yes, even sass needs authentication):
```env
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_token # Hope you've got a trust fund
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_token        # More money, more mockery
```

3. Launch the sass-factory:
```bash
npm run dev
```
